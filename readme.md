URLShortener
---------------------------

This is a really simple URL shortener written in Python and Django.

You will only need to install Django to get this to work as-is.

run `manage.py syncdb`, and follow the prompts to create a superuser. Then run `manage.py runserver` to run the server. It will start on localhost:8000.
